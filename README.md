## Requirements

We recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to setup a Python environment. Run `uv sync` under the project's root directory to create an environment same as the `uv.lock` file we provide.

We use and recommend using [vllm](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/) to serve open source models, which provides powerful reasoning and structured output parsers that we rely on.
